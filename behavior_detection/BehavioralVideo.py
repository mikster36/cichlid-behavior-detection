class BehavioralVideo:
    """
    A class to represent a video containing any amount of behavioral incidents
    That behavior can be one of the following:
    Aggressive:
        - chase / flee
    Flirting:
        - display, quiver, bower-circling / spawning, lead

    Attributes
    ----------
    video: str
        the path to a video
    tracklets_path: str
        the path to the tracklets file associated with a clip (file that ends with *_{el/bo/sk}.h5)
    frames: list[dict]
        a list of every frame in the clip, with every fish's location, velocity, and behavior at each frame
    mask_xy: tuple[int, int]
        the upper left coordinates of a rectangle mask to define where fish are in bounds
    mask_dimensions: tuple[int, int]
        the width and height of the mask to define fish in bounds as a tuple (width, height)
    batched: bool
        if the video is longer than an hour, and the gpu is not strong enough to handle analysis, then batched is true

    Methods
    -------
    calculate_velocities(...)
        gets the velocities in a clip
    create_velocity_video(...)
        makes a video with the velocities of each fish annotated

    Mask usage:
